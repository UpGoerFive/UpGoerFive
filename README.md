### Hello!

I'm a Data Scientist recently graduated from Flatiron School. I enjoy writing code to streamline the modeling and analysis process while maintaining clarity. I came to Data Science from Music, and use that practice ethic to keep doing a little every day.

After graduating from college, I realized I needed a change in direction. I started learning Python and found my way to Flatiron, which developed my enthusiasm for data analysis and machine learning. I'm eager to learn new languages and tools, so please, tell me about your project!
